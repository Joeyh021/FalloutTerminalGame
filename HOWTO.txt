This is a clone of the terminal hacking minigame from Fallout
To play, use the arrow keys to move the cursor through the text 
The aim is to guess the password using words hidden in the text 
When a word is found it will be highlighted, press enter to select it 
The game will show you how close the chosen word is to the password 
Each word has a score based on how many letters are correct and in the right place 
For example, if the password is 'nope' then 'rope' has a likeness of 3 and and 'tape' a likeness of 1 
You have 3 attempts to guess the password, or the terminal locks 
Enter 'hack' to play, or 'clear' to clear the screen 
If the game freezes, press ctrl+c to force quit it 
Thanks for playing!
