# Fallout Hacking Game
A clone of the terminal hacking minigame from Fallout 3/4/New Vegas.
Written as a project to learn C, using ncurses to interact with the terminal.
## To Compile

`make` 

If you don't already have the ncurses library installed you can install it on with `sudo apt install libncurses-dev` (or using whatever other package manager ships with your distro). 

If you're not on linux, I have no clue, and good luck.
